# ESPhomeMonitor Case

The case was designed for 3D filament printing, however resin printing should be OK.

It has three sections: bottom, top and the required number of middle sections.

Top cover and escutcheon pieces are 2mm acrylic.

The base has optional strain relief provided by a length of 3mm bar bent into a U-shape and secured by two bar-holder pieces and 3mm screws and nuts.

The board at the bottom of the case has the long expansion pins on the underside removed.

## Escutcheon pieces 
+ Squeegee white paint into letters on top surface before removing either protective sheet.
+ Remove rear protective sheet and spray paint black.
+ Remove front protective sheet and clean up any extra white paint. Adhesion will be slight, so a soft plastic scraper or fingernail should suffice.

## Top cover

+ Squeegee paint into letters on bottom surface before removing either protective sheet.
+ Remove protective sheets and clean up extra paint.

## Assembly

+ 12mm x 3mm  tapped spacers between boards.
+ 15mm x 3mm tapped spacer between Pico and top cover.
+ Mount escutcheons over boards before fitting to case. They slide into grooves in the fornt of the case.
